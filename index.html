                                <div class="intro-content"> My name is Mingquan Liu. I graduated from Worcester
                                        Polytechnic Institute as a Computer Science major and Robotics Engineering
                                        minor. After graduation, I accepted the full-time software engineer offer from
                                        Vistaprint and worked there from July 2019 to September 2020. Currently, I am
                                        working at Tongdun Technology as a frontend developer and practicing my UI
                                        designing skills.

                                <div class="intro-content">In my freetime, I like to play board games with my friends
                                        such as Monopoly and Chinese chess. Reading is also a big habbit for me. Books
                                        I read ranges from numerous topics like Economics, dective fictions or any
                                        topics I am interested in. Currenly I am reading Social Psychology by David G.
